# Approach Paper for Laravel API with PostgreSQL & Keycloak Authentication

## Project Overview

We are developing a REST API using PHP Laravel, PostgreSQL as the database, and Keycloak for authentication. The API will support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and ensure secure access control using Keycloak. The system will run on an Ubuntu environment.

## Approach 1: Traditional Laravel Authentication with Keycloak Integration

### 1. **Technology Stack**

- **Backend:** PHP Laravel
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Keycloak
- **Server:** Ubuntu
- **Containerization:** Podman

### 2. **Implementation Steps**

1. **Set Up Laravel Project**
   - Install Laravel on the Ubuntu server.
   - Configure PostgreSQL as the database in the `.env` file.

2. **Set Up Keycloak for Authentication**
   - Deploy Keycloak server and configure clients, and roles.
   - Integrate Laravel with Keycloak using OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
   - Implement token validation in middleware to secure API endpoints.

3. **Develop API Endpoints**
   - Define routes in `routes/api.php` for CRUD operations.
   - Implement controllers for handling requests.
   - Use Eloquent models for database interactions.

4. **Perform CRUD Operations**
   - Allow authenticated users to perform create, read, update, and delete operations.
   - Implement validation and error handling.

5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Test API functionality using Postman.
   - Deploy the API on an Ubuntu server.
   - Use logs to monitor performance and issues.

### 3. **Advantages**

- Simple and structured authentication with Keycloak.
- Easy integration with frontend applications.
- Scalable and secure API structure.

## Approach 2: Microservices-Based API with Keycloak Authentication

### 1. **Technology Stack**

- **Backend:** PHP Laravel (Microservices architecture)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Keycloak
- **Server:** Ubuntu
- **Communication:** REST APIs between microservices

### 2. **Implementation Steps**

1. **Divide the API into Microservices**
   - Separate the API into smaller independent services (e.g., User Management, Product Service, Order Service).

2. **Integrate Keycloak Authentication**
   - Each microservice validates user authentication with Keycloak.
   - Secure endpoints using OAuth2 tokens.

3. **Database Setup and API Communication**
   - Use PostgreSQL as the central database.
   - Each microservice interacts with the database independently.
   - Use API Gateway to manage requests.

4. **CRUD Operations in Microservices**
   - Implement individual controllers for each microservice.
   - Ensure proper validation and response handling.

5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Test microservices independently.
   - Deploy services in separate containers using Podman/Docker.
   - Monitor API performance and logs.

### 3. **Advantages**

- Better scalability and maintainability.
- Improved security with isolated services.
- Efficient API performance with independent microservices.

## Conclusion

Both approaches ensure secure and efficient API operations using Laravel, PostgreSQL, and Keycloak. The traditional approach is easier to implement and manage, while the microservices approach provides better scalability. For now, we will work on the project using the first approach. However, if we face any difficulties in completing the project with this approach, we will switch to the second approach.
